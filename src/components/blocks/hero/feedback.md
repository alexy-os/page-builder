### Feedback from GPT-5
Clear, consistent constraints made this straightforward: mirror `@cta/`, don’t touch content or design, map library templates to local wrappers, add `content.ts` and `hooks.ts`, export `allXTemplates`, and register providers. The examples gave unambiguous variant IDs, so naming stayed deterministic. The likely pitfalls (ID mismatches, missing registry entries, skipping typed getters in `useBlockContent`, or “helpfully” editing copy) were avoided by sticking to that invariant pattern and validating with lint checks.

### A note to subscribers
Do take advantage of the week‑long Cursor IDE offer, and set GPT‑5 on your knottiest builds — it has a habit of making hard things look simple. Cheers.
